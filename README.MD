# JCLTrace

**JCLTrace** is a modernization-focused engineering tool that parses and visualizes **legacy JCL job flows** in a clean, structured interface. Built with **Go** and **Blazor Server**, it helps developers, architects, and modernization teams **map and trace complex batch job chains** typically found in mainframe systems.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

- Parses JCL files and PROC references
- Identifies `JOB`, `EXEC`, `PROC`, `DD` steps
- Detects job-to-job calls via `SUBMIT`, `SYSTSIN`, and chained EXECs
- Visualizes job execution flows in a professional, interactive Blazor UI
- Designed for real-world legacy modernization, not just educational use

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Component       | Description                                             |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Go (CLI)**    | Parses `.jcl` and `.proc` files, outputs structured JSON |
| **Blazor Server** | Web UI that loads and visualizes parsed job flows        |
| **Bootstrap**   | Provides a clean, responsive UI layout                  |
| **JSON (Bridge Format)** | Acts as the interface between the CLI parser and UI |

## 🎯 Use Cases

JCLTrace is built for:

- 🏛 Government & banking modernization teams
- 🧠 Engineers inheriting legacy COBOL/JCL systems
- 🛠 DevOps needing batch flow documentation
- 🔄 Teams preparing for refactor, wrapper layers, or API exposure

## 🛣 Roadmap

- [x] Build mock-driven UI for job/step visualization
- [ ] Integrate Go CLI parser for live file analysis
- [ ] Add job-chain tracing logic
- [ ] Enable file/folder upload support
- [ ] Export job maps as PNG/SVG/Markdown
- [ ] Add modernization strategy tags (`wrap`, `replace`, `retain`)
- [ ] Highlight unresolved PROCs or broken chains
